# burger

## Overview
A Node, Express, Handlebars, and MySQL burger app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat which shows up on the left side of the page, then if the user hits the devour button it moves to the right side of the page since it's been devoured.  It hits the MYSQL database once entered (adds id, name and boolean) and changes the boolean once 'devoured'.
